# Spaceship Game!

Use w/a/s/d to move laterally via velocity. Press shift and arrow keys to "teleport" laterally.

Use `a`/`d` to spin the ship left/right and `w`/`s` to boost forward/backward. This control scheme is the closest to how the final game will play.

Press `b` for debug information.

## Running

Install [love2D](https://love2d.org/) and run `love .` in the main directory. That's it!

Of course, this game is still in development, so please expect bugs.
